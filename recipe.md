Slice the courgette into thin stips like the tempeh approx ½ cm thick. On a baking tray lined with parchment paper, mix the courgettes with 1 tbsp of oil and a generous pinch of salt, spread the courgettes out well so they are well spaced. In another lined baking tray coat the tempeh or aubergine strips in the remaining BBQ sauce so they are well coated and spread in an even layer.
4. Bake the Tempeh/aubergine strips and courgette in the preheated oven for 12 mins with no need to turn.  Take out the tempeh/ aubergine and set aside. Carefully turn the courgette slices and bake for a further 10 mins. Remove and let  cool.
